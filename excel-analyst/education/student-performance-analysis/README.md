![Dashboard Screenshot](./dashboard/dashboard-overview.JPG)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of student academic performance to identify key factors that influence scores in math, reading, and writing. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains demographic, socioeconomic, and academic data for 1,000 students.

> **Goal:**  
> Discover which factors (e.g., test preparation, gender, parental education) most impact students’ performance, and provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- 📁 Source: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- 📊 Rows: 1,000 students
- 📋 Columns:
  - `gender`

## 🔍 Steps Followed (Data Analysis Lifecycle)

### 1. **Ask**
- Why do some students perform poorly in academic exams?
- What external or demographic factors impact academic performance?

### 2. **Prepare**
- Cleaned missing values (none found)
- Added new columns:
  - `Average Score`: mean of math, reading, writing
  - `Performance Category`: Classified as Excellent / Average / Poor

### 3. **Process**
- Created Pivot Tables and Summary Statistics
- Segmented data by gender, test preparation, and parental education
- Categorized student risk levels

### 4. **Analyze**
- Students who completed test preparation scored ~8 points higher
- Males outperform in Math; females excel in Reading and Writing
- Higher parental education correlates with higher average scores

### 5. **Share**
- Created KPI dashboard in Excel
- Built PowerPoint summary slide deck
- Visualized key findings (see below)

### 6. **Act**
- Recommend test preparation programs
- Target support for at-risk students
- Personalize learning strategies by demographic insights
